<u><b>How HTML works</b></u>
<br><p>HTML documents use "tags" to what to show on the browser.
  <br>There are two types of <b>ELEMENTS</b> described by "tags".
  <br>One of them is called  <b>BLOCK elements</b> which can be described as below.
  <br><br><b>&lt;OPENING TAG>&lt;contents>&lt;/CLOSING TAG></b>
  <br><br>Opening tags and Closing tags have exactly the same name except closing tags have "/"at the beginning of the tags.
<br>Examples of block elements are described as follows.
<br>
<br>&lt;b>content&lt;/b>:<b>Make contents bolded</b>
<br>&lt;em>content&lt;/em>:<em>Make contents Italic</em>
<br>
<br>The other ELEMENTS are called <b>INLINE elements</b>.
  <br><br><b>&lt;TAG>&lt;contents></b><br>
<br>Inline tags have only one tag alone.
<br>Examples of inline elements are described as follows.
<br>
<br>&lt;br>:Begin a new line
<br>&lt;img>:Display an image
<br>
<br>Some of the tags have <b>HTML attributes</b>.
<br>In case of block elements, HTML attributes looks like this.
<br>
<br><b>&lt;TAG ATTR="value">conetnts&lt;/TAGS></b>
<br>
<br>For inline elements, HTML attributes looks like this.
<br>
